# Tetris JS
This is the classic game of Tetris written in pure HTML (No Canvas 2D Controls). It simply uses HTML Tables and JQuery for rendering, and is surprisingly pretty fast.

Wide browser support on both desktop and mobile devices. I spent quite a bit of time tweaking the touch controls to make it feel smooth and responsive on any smartphone. I used the following styles to extend the touch surface on the entire screen:

```css
body, html {
    height: 100%;
}
```

The code is written in TypeScript, to run and compile it locally use the following commands:

`npm install`

`tsc`

Please send any feedback.

Thanks!
